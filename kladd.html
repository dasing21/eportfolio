<h3>Solutions</h3>
<code>
    /*
    To solve the problem of finding the probability that a fair die lands with an even number on , we need to follow these steps:
     1. Identify the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a fair die
     2. Identify the number of favorable outcomes for landing on an even number
     3. Calculate the probability using the formula:
        P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes        
    Calculating the probability:    
        P(Even number) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes 
        P(Even number) = 3 / 6
        P(Even number) = 1 / 2
    The probability that a fair die lands with an even number on top is 1/2 or 0,5

    Calculating the robability that a randomly chosen UK man who dies in a future year will die of CHD
	P(Male death of CHD) = Number of male deaths from CHD / Total number of male deaths
	P(Male death of CHD) = 64 473 / 288 332
	P(Male death of CHD) = 0,2237
    The probability that a randomly chosen UK man who dies in a future year will die of CHD is 0,2237, or 22,37%

    Calculating the probability that a randomly chosen UK woman who dies in a future year will die of CHD
        P(Female death of CHD) = Number of female deaths from CHD / Total number of female deaths
        P(Female death of CHD) = 53 003 / 318 463
        P(Female death of CHD) = 0,1664
    The probability that a randomly chosen UK woman who dies in a future year will die of CHD is 0,1664, or 16,64%
    */
    /*
    How accurate are your estimates likely to be?
    The estimates are based on large amounts of data from 2002. 
    Assuming that the probability from CHD has not changed since 2002, these estimate will be very good.
