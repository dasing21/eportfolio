<h3>Data Activity 7</h3>
<p>Using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset, perform the following
    activities:</p>
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Create a crosstab to assess how individualsâ€™ experience of any crime in the previous 12 months bcsvictim vary by
        age group agegrp7. </li>
    <li>Create the crosstab with bcsvictim in the rows and agegrp7 in the columns, and produce row percentages, rounded
        to 2 decimal places.</li>
    <li>Looking at the crosstab you have produced, which age groups were the most likely, and least likely, to be
        victims of crime?</li>
</ul>
Learning Outcomes:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Systematic understanding of the key mathematical and statistical concepts and techniques which underpin
        mechanisms in Data Science and AI.</li>
    <li>Apply mathematical and statistical methods in these fields to help in the decision-making
        process.</li>
    <li>Critically evaluate the use of statistical analysis and the numeric interpretation of results as aids in the
        decision-making process.</li>
</ul>
