    /*
    1. Model Summary:

    The regression model used is:
    dbp = β0 + β1 * sbp
    
    2. Coefficients:
    
    The coefficients table shows the estimated values for the intercept β0 and the slope β1:
    Intercept β0 = 19.4068
     - This is the estimated value of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when systolic blood pressure (SBP) is zero. 
     Although it's not practically meaningful to have an SBP of zero, it provides a baseline for the model. 
    Slope β1 = 0.4960
      - This is the estimated change in DBP for each one-unit increase in SBP. Specifically, for each additional 
      unit of SBP, DBP is expected to increase by 0.4960 units.
    
    3. Statistical Significance:
    
    The p-value for the slope β1 is < 2e-16, which is much less than the 5% significance level (0.05). This 
    indicates that the relationship between SBP and DBP is statistically significant.
    The t-value for the slope β1 is 22.961, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis H0 
    (which states that there is no relationship between SBP and DBP).
    
    4. Goodness of Fit:
    
    Multiple R-squared R2 = 0.7171
     - This indicates that approximately 71.71% of the variability in DBP can be explained by SBP. This 
     suggests a strong linear relationship between SBP and DBP.
    Adjusted R-squared R2: 0.7157
     - Similar to the R-squared but adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. Since there is only 
     one predictor, it is almost the same as the R-squared.
    
    5. Residual Standard Error (RSE):
    
    Residual standard error: 6.264 on 208 degrees of freedom
    This is the standard deviation of the residuals (errors). It gives an estimate of the typical size of 
    the errors in the model's predictions. 
    A lower value indicates a better fit, but the value itself should be interpreted in the context of the 
    data's scale.
    
    6. F-statistic:
    F-statistic: 527.2 on 1 and 208 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16
    This statistic tests the overall significance of the model. 
    The very small p-value indicates that the model is highly significant.
    
    Interpretation at 5% Significance Level:
    
    1. Significant Relationship:
     - There is a statistically significant relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
     blood pressure (DBP) at the 5% level of significance. 
     - The p-value for the SBP coefficient is less than 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis H0 
     that β1 = 0
    
    2. Model Fit:
     - The model explains a substantial proportion of the variability in DBP, as indicated by the high R-squared 
     value R2 (71.71%).
    
    3. Predictive Power:
     - For each unit increase in SBP, DBP increases by approximately 0.496 units.
    
    4. Reliability of Estimates:
     - The small standard errors and high t-values suggest that our coefficient estimates are reliable
    
    Conclusion:
    At a 5% level of significance, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a significant predictor of diastolic 
    blood pressure (DBP). 
    The regression model fits the data well, explaining about 71.71% of the variability in DBP. 
    The relationship is positive, meaning as SBP increases, DBP also increases.
    
    The regression analysis provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the 
    alternative hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that there is a significant relationship between 
    systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at the 5% significance level.
