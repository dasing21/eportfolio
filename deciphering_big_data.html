                            In this thread, we explored the exciting potential and significant challenges associated
                            with the Internet of Things (IoT) and its vast data generation. Here are some of the key
                            points that were made in the discussion:
                            <br><br>
                            Real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and automation across various sectors like
                            healthcare and smart cities are some of the benefits that are provided by IoT. However there
                            are challenges in regards to IoT, particulairly in managing IoT Data. Managing the volume of
                            data requires robust data cleaning and management practices for accurate insights (Huxley et
                            al., 2020). In regards of privacy and security, Data collection from IoT devices raises
                            ethical concerns and necessitates strong safeguards to protect sensitive information
                            (Tawalbeh, 2020).
                            <br><br>
                            Building a robust IoT infrastructure requires careful consideration of cloud-based solutions
                            and data compliance regulations (Google Cloud, 2024). Selecting the appropriate data storage
                            type (RDBMS, NoSQL, etc.) and applying an efficient framework are crucial for optimal
                            storage, processing, and analysis (Cai et al., 2017).
                            <br><br>
                            Some additional considerations which were addressed, were in terms of Balancing Data
                            Protection and Real-Time Analytics. Striking a balance between data security and real-time
                            processing for optimal decision-making is a key challenge (Google Cloud, 2024).
                            <br><br>
                            Considering privacy and security, following principles like data minimization, user consent,
                            and data security is essential to mitigate privacy concerns (Sarrab & Alshohoumi, 2020).
                            <br><br>
                            Moving forward, I think the successful implementation of IoT relies on addressing these
                            challenges through robust data management practices, prioritizing security, and adhering to
                            privacy principles. Collaboration between stakeholders like cloud service providers and data
                            security experts will be crucial to harnessing the full potential of this transformative
                            technology.

                            This post dives into the security requirements for personal data under the General Data
                            Protection Regulation (GDPR) and compares them to the regulations in Norway, specifically
                            the Personal Data Act (PDA) of 2018.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>GDPR Standards:</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The GDPR doesn't prescribe specific technical measures but emphasizes "appropriate security"
                            based on factors like the type of data, processing risks, and the industry (European
                            Commission, 2018). This means organizations must assess their individual needs and implement
                            controls like:
                            <li>Pseudonymization and encryption: Transforming personal data to minimize identification
                                risks (European Commission, 2018).</li>
                            <li>Access controls: Limiting access to personal data based on the "need-to-know" principle.
                            </li>
                            <li>Regular security assessments: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities (European
                                Commission, 2018).</li>
                            <li>Data breach notification: Reporting breaches to authorities and affected individuals
                                within specified timelines (European Commission, 2018).</li>
                            <br>
                            <b>Norwegian Similarities and Differences:</b>
                            <br><br>
                            Norway's PDA largely mirrors the GDPR's security principle. Section 13 outlines the
                            "security and confidentiality" requirements, emphasizing "appropriate technical and
                            organizational measures" to safeguard personal data (Lovdata, 2018). However, there are some
                            nuances. The PDA allows for exemptions for specific data categories under certain
                            circumstances. This means that in some situations, Norwegian organizations may not need to
                            comply with the same strict security measures required by the GDPR for certain types of
                            data.
                            <br><br>
                            However, these exemptions may not always align with the GDPR exemptions. This means that
                            there could be instances where a data category that is exempt from strict security measures
                            under the PDA might still require such measures under the GDPR. This could lead to potential
                            compliance challenges for organizations operating in both Norway and the EU. To ensure
                            compliance with both sets of regulations, it is important for organizations to carefully
                            review the specific exemptions available under both the PDA and the GDPR and to implement
                            security measures that are consistent with the most stringent requirements (Lovdata, 2018)

                            For this exercise, I have chosen a popular and widely used API: the Google Cloud Storage
                            API. This API allows for the storage and retrieval of files of various formats, including
                            XML, JSON, and SQL (Google Cloud, N.D.). <br> <br>

                            Given the nature of the Google Cloud Storage API and its use for data sharing, there are
                            several potential security risks: <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unauthorized Access:</li>

                                <li>If not properly secured, the API could be accessed by unauthorized individuals,
                                    leading to data breaches.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in the API to steal sensitive data.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Evaluating Module Projects</h3>
                        <p>
                            The final project (Unit 11) meets the objectives outlined in the initial proposal (Unit 6),
                            demonstrating a well-structured database design with clear adherence to stock control,
                            customer data management, and order processing needs. The final report includes a detailed
                            ERD, which provides a clearer visualization of the database structure than the initial
                            proposal. Additionally, the final project emphasizes GDPR compliance and data security
                            measures, addressing legal considerations that were only briefly mentioned in the initial
                            proposal (European Commission, 2018).
                            <br> <br>
                            Moreover, the final project justifies the choice of MySQL over NoSQL, highlighting the
                            importance of ACID transactions and robust security features, crucial for the structured and
                            transaction-heavy nature of the business (Kunda & Phiri, 2017). The initial proposal had
                            considered NoSQL, but the final project clearly explains why MySQL's structured approach was
                            more suitable (IBM, 2021). While both versions recognize scalability concerns, the final
                            project provides a more in-depth plan for future growth, although further elaboration on
                            this aspect would still be beneficial (Brantner et al., 2008).
                            <br><br>
                            Overall, the final project builds upon the initial proposal by adding technical details and
                            addressing both operational and legal requirements comprehensively.

                        <h3>Impact on Professional Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            This module has enhanced my professional development as a software test and
                            quality assurance (QA) engineer, particularly in understanding database design and its
                            critical role in system efficiency and data integrity. Prior to this, my focus was primarily
                            on testing software functionality and automating test cases, but working on this module
                            deepened my understanding of database architecture, which is essential for identifying
                            potential areas of failure and ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.
                            <br> <br>
                            The emphasis on data integrity has improved my approach to database testing, especially for
                            scenarios involving concurrency and transaction
                            rollbacks, which are crucial in test automation. Moreover, learning about GDPR compliance
                            (European Commission, 2018) has expanded my awareness of security testing, particularly in
                            ensuring that personal data is handled securely within systems. This is especially important
                            as data breaches are a growing concern in software development.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, working with this module reinforced the importance of scalability in
                            performance testing,
                            particularly for large datasets, which I may now incorporate into
                            automated performance tests to ensure long-term system reliability. Overall, this experience
                            has broadened my skillset, making me a more well-rounded QA engineer.
