						<h2>Navigating Wales: A Perspective on Transportation Challenges in Wales</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
					<h3>Introduction</h3> Transportation is a crucial facet of societal functionality, shaping the daily
					lives of
					citizens. This report seeks to provide insight into the state of transportation in Wales from a
					citizen's standpoint, addressing key issues impacting their daily experiences. Wales, with its
					stunning landscapes and vibrant communities, presents a unique set of challenges
					in its transportation infrastructure. Citizens often express concerns about the accessibility
					and reliability of public transport, particularly in rural areas where limited connectivity
					hampers daily commutes. The reliance on personal vehicles in such regions raises environmental
					concerns, emphasizing the need for sustainable alternatives (Welsh Government, 2022).<br><br>

					Furthermore, citizens have voiced frustrations regarding traffic congestion in urban centers
					like Cardiff and Swansea, affecting travel times and air quality (Deacon, T., 2020). The demand
					for improved public transit options and the integration of smart technologies to alleviate
					congestion is a common sentiment among residents. Additionally, the emphasis on sustainable and
					eco-friendly modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, is gaining traction among
					citizens keen on reducing their carbon footprint. The need for comprehensive urban planning that
					prioritizes pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and cycling lanes is evident in public discourse
					(Waters, 2023). A holistic approach to transportation issues in Wales is imperative. Addressing
					citizens' concerns, promoting sustainable alternatives, and enhancing public transit are crucial
					steps towards creating a well-connected and environmentally conscious transportation system
					(Welsh Government, 2022).<br><br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Data overview</h3>
					The dataset under consideration is the "National Survey for Wales results,
					2013-14: Transport."
					(Welsh Government, NST., 2014). This dataset aims to gather insights into diverse aspects,
					including demographics, preferences, and opinions, providing a rich source of data for
					analysis and decision-making. For this report, I have specifically chosen four of the 42
					tables in the dataset in order to analyze based on four specific factors:<br><br>

					<li>Factor 1: Feeling of safety travelling by public transport, by age (table 40)</li>
					<li>Factor 2: Ease of getting to and from GP surgery, by age (table 30)</li>
					<li>Factor 3: Ease of getting to and from hospital, by age (table 38)</li>
					<li>Factor 4: Have use of a car (table 15)</li><br><br>

					In table 30 and 38, the responses are divided into four answers:<br><br>

					<ol>
						<li>Very easy</li>
						<li>Fairly easy</li>
						<li>Fairly difficult</li>
						<li>Very difficult</li>
					</ol><br>

					Each response is quantified with a percentage value for the respondent's age group. There are
					<b>four age groups:</b><br><br>

					<ol>
						<li>16-24</li>
						<li>25-44</li>
						<li>45-64</li>
						<li>75+</li>
					</ol><br>

					There is also a value, "Total", which is the average of the responses of the aforementioned four age
					groups.<br><br>

					In Table 40, the responses are divided into 4 different answers:<br><br>

					<ol>
						<li>Very safe</li>
						<li>Fairly safe</li>
						<li>Fairly unsafe</li>
						<li>Very unsafe</li>
					</ol><br>

					The responses are quantified the same way as in aforementioned tables, table 30 and 38, - with a
					percentage value and the same four age groups, including an average "Total".<br><br>
					In table 15, the responses are divided into two answers:<br><br>

					<ol>
						<li>Yes</li>
						<li>No</li>
					</ol><br>

					Each response is quantified with a percentage value, divided into three categories:<br><br>

					<ol>
						<li>Upper CI</li>
						<li>Lower CI</li>
					</ol><br>

					There is also a third category, "Average", which represents the average of the upper and lower
					CI.<br>
					<br></p>
					<p>
					<h3>Data analysis design</h3>
					Data reduction is a crucial step in a quantitative analysis process to enhance efficiency, reduce
					complexity, and extract meaningful information from large and complex datasets (Al Mahdi, 2020) .
					Therefore, for table 40, 30, and 38, I will only extract the "Total" value from each table to
					represent the value. Similarly, in table 15, I will only extract the "Average" value.<br><br>

					To illustrate these relationships visually, a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram has been
					constructed (see Figure 1, Overview). The diagrams depict the factors "Have use of a car", "Feeling
					of safety", "Ease of getting to/from GP surgery", and "Ease of getting to/from hospital". These
					models give us a simple overview of the factors in question. Diagrams have been created using
					draw.io. I have chosen to use Class diagrams to model the data. Modelling the static view our
					system, it is an appropriate choice of diagram. It also describes the relationships among objects
					(Visual Paradigm, no date).<br><br>

					<h4>Figure 1: Overview</h4><br><br>

					This second UML diagram, gives us the details of the four factors and the data types to be
					analyzed:<br><br>

					<h4>Figure 2: Data structure view</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig2.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					After reducing the data, we have the following information: <br><br>

					<h4>Figure 3: Detail view</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig3.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					Now, let us analyze the data that we have. <br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Analysis</h3>
					The descriptive analysis technique is a fitting approach for examining public transport in Wales due
					to its ability to provide a comprehensive and clear overview of the survey data. This method is
					particularly advantageous for summarizing and interpreting the key characteristics of the dataset
					without delving into complex statistical models, making it accessible and easily understandable for
					a diverse audience (Indeed Editorial Team, 2022). All charts have been created using Python and the
					Matplotlib library.<br><br>

					<h4>Factor 1 - Safety perception</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig4.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					Concerns about safety, particularly during nighttime travel, were explored in factor 1. The
					responses indicate that 34% felt very safe, 46% felt fairly safe, 15% felt fairly unsafe, and 5%
					felt very unsafe using public transport after dark. These findings suggest a relatively positive
					overall safety perception, although addressing the concerns of the 20% who feel either fairly or
					very unsafe should be a priority for improving public transport services. <br><br>

					<h4>Factor 2 - Ease of transportation to/from GP surgery:</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig5.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					Access to essential services, particularly healthcare facilities, is vital for public well-being.
					For accessing GP surgeries 66% reported it as very easy, 27% as fairly easy, 5% as fairly difficult,
					and 2% as very difficult. <br><br>

					<h4>Factor 3 - Ease of transportation to/from hospital:</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig6.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					Similarly, for accessing hospital, 48% found it very easy, 34% fairly easy, 14% fairly difficult,
					and 5% very difficult. These results highlight the overall accessibility of healthcare facilities
					for the majority, but challenges still exist for a small percentage. Policymakers may need to focus
					on addressing barriers faced by those finding it difficult to reach healthcare services. <br><br>

					<h4>Factor 4 - Car dependency:</h4><br><br>
					<img src="images/tdpFig7.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="Could not load image"><br><br>

					The majority of respondents, 79%, expressed a need for a car. This high percentage indicates a
					significant reliance on personal vehicles, which may be attributed to factors such as limited public
					transport coverage, convenience, or the perceived inadequacy of existing public transportation
					options. This finding aligns with previous studies highlighting the challenges faced by public
					transport systems in rural areas, such as those often found in Wales (Waters, 2023).
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Data visualization</h3>
					To visualize the data, I have used bar chart diagrams and a pie chart. The charts are descriptive of
					the analysis and allows for a straightforward presentation of the survey results in terms of
					percentages. This simplicity aids in conveying the main findings concisely, making it suitable for
					policymakers, researchers, and the general public who may not necessarily have a specialized
					background in statistics (Erkilinc, 2023).<br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Discussion on choice of analysis design technique</h3>
					Data analysis design techniques play a pivotal role in extracting meaningful insights from datasets.
					This post aims to delve into the strengths and limitations of various data analysis design
					techniques, shedding light on their diverse applications and potential pitfalls.<br>

					One widely employed technique is Descriptive Statistics, providing a succinct summary of key
					features in a dataset (Curtin University, no date). Its strength lies in simplifying complex data,
					enabling a quick overview. However, it may oversimplify relationships and fail to uncover deeper
					patterns. <br>

					Moving to more advanced methods, Inferential Statistics enables drawing inferences about populations
					based on sample data (Curtin University, no date). Its strength lies in generalizability, but
					assumptions about the population may limit its accuracy. <br>

					To summarize, the choice of data analysis design technique should align with the research objectives
					and the nature of the data. A hybrid approach, combining multiple techniques, may offer a
					comprehensive understanding while mitigating individual limitations. <br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Possible solutions</h3>
					To address the identified transportation challenges in Wales, several solutions can be implemented.
					These solutions aim to enhance accessibility, reliability, and sustainability while mitigating
					associated limitations and risks. Below are some potential strategies:<br><br>

					<h4>1. Enhanced public transit infrastructure</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Invest in improving and expanding public transit networks, especially in rural areas where
							connectivity is limited (Welsh Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Introduce new routes, increase frequency, and extend operating hours to accommodate diverse
							travel needs and preferences (Deacon, 2020).</li>
						<li>Implement integrated ticketing systems and real-time passenger information to enhance
							convenience and encourage modal shift from private vehicles to public transit (Welsh
							Government,
							2022).</li>
					</ul><br><br>

					<h4>2. Promotion of sustainable transportation modes</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Encourage cycling and walking by developing dedicated infrastructure such as cycle lanes,
							pedestrian zones, and safe crossing points (Waters, 2023).</li>
						<li>Provide incentives for adopting eco-friendly transportation modes, such as subsidies for
							purchasing bicycles, electric scooters, or hybrid vehicles (Welsh Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Promote carpooling and ridesharing initiatives to reduce the number of single-occupancy
							vehicles
							on the road and alleviate congestion (Deacon, 2020).</li>
					</ul><br><br>

					<h4>3. Technological integration and innovation</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Deploy smart transportation solutions, including traffic management systems, intelligent
							signaling, and predictive analytics, to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion (Welsh
							Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Harness advancements in autonomous vehicles and shared mobility services to enhance mobility
							options and improve efficiency in urban transportation (Deacon, 2020).</li>
						<li>Foster partnerships with technology companies and research institutions to pilot innovative
							solutions and evaluate their effectiveness in addressing transportation challenges (Welsh
							Government, 2022).</li>
					</ul><br><br>

					<h4>4. Community engagement and participatory planning</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Involve citizens, community groups, and stakeholders in the decision-making process for
							transportation planning and infrastructure development (Waters, 2023).</li>
						<li>Conduct regular surveys, focus groups, and public consultations to gather feedback, identify
							priorities, and ensure that transportation initiatives align with the needs and preferences
							of the population (Welsh Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Encourage collaboration between local authorities, transportation agencies, and
							environmental organizations to implement holistic and sustainable transportation solutions
							(Deacon, 2020).</li>
					</ul><br><br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Risks associated with possible solutions</h3>
					However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential limitations and risks associated with these
					solutions:<br><br>
					<h4>1. Financial constraints</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementing large-scale transportation projects requires significant investment, and
							securing funding may pose a challenge, particularly in times of economic uncertainty (Welsh
							Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Cover-reliance on public funding may limit the scope and pace of infrastructure development,
							delaying the implementation of necessary improvements (Deacon, 2020).</li>
					</ul><br><br>
					<h4>Technical challenges</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Introducing new technologies and smart transportation systems may face technical hurdles
							such as compatibility issues, cybersecurity threats, and data privacy concerns (Welsh
							Government, 2022).</li>
						<li>Maintaining and upgrading infrastructure to accommodate emerging technologies requires
							ongoing investment and expertise, which may strain existing resources (Deacon, 2020).</li>
					</ul><br><br>
					<h4>Social and cultural factors</h4> <br>
					<ul>
						<li>Changing travel behavior and promoting sustainable transportation modes require cultural
							shifts and behavior change campaigns, which may encounter resistance or skepticism from
							certain segments of the population (Waters, 2023).</li>
						<li>Addressing inequalities in access to transportation services and infrastructure necessitates
							a comprehensive approach that considers socio-economic disparities and demographic
							differences (Welsh Government, 2022).</li>
					</ul><br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					In conclusion, overcoming transportation challenges in Wales requires a multi-faceted approach that
					combines infrastructure investment, technological innovation, community engagement, and policy
					intervention. While these solutions offer promising opportunities for improvement, careful
					consideration of their limitations and associated risks is essential to ensure effective
					implementation and long-term sustainability.<br>
