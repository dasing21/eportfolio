                        <p>
                            Read Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023).
                            <br><br>
                            From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of
                            activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science,
                            which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing
                            new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been
                            slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.
                            <br><br>
                            In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to
                            define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in
                            establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various
                            stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy
                            makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the
                            world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.”
                            <br><br>
                            After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with
                            the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think
                            could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any
                            papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry
                            have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also
                            highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional
                            issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help
                            you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing

                            The Accessibility in Software Development case study highlights the ethical dilemma of
                            balancing client deadlines with the responsibility to create inclusive products. My initial
                            analysis emphasised that omitting accessibility features risks discriminating against users
                            with disabilities, violating ACM Principles 1.1 (contribute to society) and 1.4 (act fairly
                            and avoid discrimination) (ACM, 2018), as well as BCS duties to uphold equality, diversity,
                            and public interest (BCS, 2024). Such omissions can also trigger legal consequences under
                            frameworks like the UK Equality Act 2010 and WCAG standards (W3C, 2018).
                            <br><br>
                            Peer feedback from Julius Cloos deepened this perspective by highlighting ACM Principle 1.2,
                            which stresses adherence to best practices, and Principle 2.3, which encourages following
                            professional standards to avoid wasted effort on inaccessible features (Horton, 2025).
                            Implementing accessibility from the outset not only aligns with ethical codes, but also
                            prevents inefficiencies and reputational damage.
                            <br><br>
                            The peer feedback from Md Chowdhury reinforced that accessibility should be treated as a
                            core quality attribute, comparable to security or performance. Building it in early reduces
                            technical debt, minimises costly rework, and demonstrates a commitment to inclusive design
                            as a business value. This framing can help secure stakeholder buy-in, even under tight
                            deadlines.
                            <br><br>
                            Both the ACM and BCS codes frame accessibility as an ethical imperative, not an optional
                            enhancement. The discussion confirms that proactive, integrated accessibility practices
                            support legal compliance, uphold professional integrity, and strengthen trust with users.
                            Balancing commercial pressures with these responsibilities ensures technology serves all
                            members of society, fulfilling the broader purpose of the computing profession.

                            The case of Abi and the Whizzz cereal study has prompted a valuable exchange on integrity,
                            responsibility, and the pressures of commercial interest. My initial post argued that Abi’s
                            duty is to present the data transparently, reflecting both positive and negative findings.
                            This position aligns with the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (2024),
                            which stress honesty, the avoidance of harm, and the protection of the public interest.
                            <br><br>
                            Valentina’s responses reinforced that data integrity is fundamental to sustaining public
                            trust in science. Once findings are perceived as biased or manipulated, credibility is
                            difficult to restore. This aligns with O’Neil’s (2016) critique that misapplied statistical
                            models can have far-reaching societal consequences. The point that responsibility extends
                            beyond one company or study is well made; the perception of bias can erode confidence in
                            entire professions.
                            <br><br>
                            Valentina also asked whether Abi could ever justify prioritising the manufacturer’s
                            interests, for instance if the “harmful” results came from a small sample or weak
                            statistical test. I would argue that even in such cases, Abi cannot ethically suppress or
                            downplay those results. Instead, he should report them transparently with clear caveats
                            about sample size, robustness, and uncertainty. The European Food Safety Authority (2019)
                            guidance on uncertainty emphasises that limitations must be communicated explicitly so
                            stakeholders understand the strength of the evidence. Suppressing unfavourable outcomes
                            risks misleading stakeholders, violating ethical codes, and undermining trust.
                            <br><br>
                            In conclusion, Abi’s responsibility is not only technical but moral. By reporting fully and
                            contextualising uncertainty, he upholds professional integrity, safeguards public health,
                            and protects the credibility of both science and computing practice.

                        <p>
                            In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore,
                            2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained
                            the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and
                            probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for
                            alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various
                            media.
                            <br><br>
                            Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of
                            inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various
                            ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.
                        </p>
