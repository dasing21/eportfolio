                        <p>
                            Read Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023).
                            <br><br>
                            From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of
                            activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science,
                            which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing
                            new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been
                            slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.
                            <br><br>
                            In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to
                            define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in
                            establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various
                            stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy
                            makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the
                            world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.”
                            <br><br>
                            After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with
                            the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think
                            could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any
                            papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry
                            have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also
                            highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional
                            issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help
                            you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing

                            The Accessibility in Software Development case study highlights the ethical dilemma of
                            balancing client deadlines with the responsibility to create inclusive products. My initial
                            analysis emphasised that omitting accessibility features risks discriminating against users
                            with disabilities, violating ACM Principles 1.1 (contribute to society) and 1.4 (act fairly
                            and avoid discrimination) (ACM, 2018), as well as BCS duties to uphold equality, diversity,
                            and public interest (BCS, 2024). Such omissions can also trigger legal consequences under
                            frameworks like the UK Equality Act 2010 and WCAG standards (W3C, 2018).
                            <br><br>
                            Peer feedback from Julius Cloos deepened this perspective by highlighting ACM Principle 1.2,
                            which stresses adherence to best practices, and Principle 2.3, which encourages following
                            professional standards to avoid wasted effort on inaccessible features (Horton, 2025).
                            Implementing accessibility from the outset not only aligns with ethical codes, but also
                            prevents inefficiencies and reputational damage.
                            <br><br>
                            The peer feedback from Md Chowdhury reinforced that accessibility should be treated as a
                            core quality attribute, comparable to security or performance. Building it in early reduces
                            technical debt, minimises costly rework, and demonstrates a commitment to inclusive design
                            as a business value. This framing can help secure stakeholder buy-in, even under tight
                            deadlines.
                            <br><br>
                            Both the ACM and BCS codes frame accessibility as an ethical imperative, not an optional
                            enhancement. The discussion confirms that proactive, integrated accessibility practices
                            support legal compliance, uphold professional integrity, and strengthen trust with users.
                            Balancing commercial pressures with these responsibilities ensures technology serves all
                            members of society, fulfilling the broader purpose of the computing profession.

                            The case of Abi and the Whizzz cereal study has prompted a valuable exchange on integrity,
                            responsibility, and the pressures of commercial interest. My initial post argued that Abi’s
                            duty is to present the data transparently, reflecting both positive and negative findings.
                            This position aligns with the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (2024),
                            which stress honesty, the avoidance of harm, and the protection of the public interest.
                            <br><br>
                            Valentina’s responses reinforced that data integrity is fundamental to sustaining public
                            trust in science. Once findings are perceived as biased or manipulated, credibility is
                            difficult to restore. This aligns with O’Neil’s (2016) critique that misapplied statistical
                            models can have far-reaching societal consequences. The point that responsibility extends
                            beyond one company or study is well made; the perception of bias can erode confidence in
                            entire professions.
                            <br><br>
                            Valentina also asked whether Abi could ever justify prioritising the manufacturer’s
                            interests, for instance if the “harmful” results came from a small sample or weak
                            statistical test. I would argue that even in such cases, Abi cannot ethically suppress or
                            downplay those results. Instead, he should report them transparently with clear caveats
                            about sample size, robustness, and uncertainty. The European Food Safety Authority (2019)
                            guidance on uncertainty emphasises that limitations must be communicated explicitly so
                            stakeholders understand the strength of the evidence. Suppressing unfavourable outcomes
                            risks misleading stakeholders, violating ethical codes, and undermining trust.
                            <br><br>
                            In conclusion, Abi’s responsibility is not only technical but moral. By reporting fully and
                            contextualising uncertainty, he upholds professional integrity, safeguards public health,
                            and protects the credibility of both science and computing practice.

                        <p>
                            In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore,
                            2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained
                            the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and
                            probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for
                            alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various
                            media.
                            <br><br>
                            Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of
                            inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various
                            ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            This reflection summarises my learning journey through the Research Methods and Professional
                            Practice module. I will use the "What?, So what?, Now what?" model by Rolfe et al. (2001),
                            as outlined in the University of Edinburgh’s Reflectors’ Toolkit (University of Edinburgh,
                            n.d.). The module has been one of the most valuable parts of my studies so far because it
                            helped me connect theory, analysis, and professional practice in a meaningful way. It
                            challenged me to think more critically, apply research metho ds with confidence, and reflect
                            on my growth as both a student and working as a professional software quality test engineer.
                        </p>
                        <h3>WHAT?</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the start of this module, my understanding of research was fairly limited. I had
                            experience with processes performed when conducting research, such as collecting data and
                            analysing it. However, as the module progressed, I began to see research as a structured and
                            reflective process that requires planning, justification, and ethical consideration.
                            <br><br>
                            Developing my literature review and research proposal was one of the most important
                            milestones. My topic focused on building a sentiment-analysis framework using machine
                            learning to process customer feedback. Initially, my work was descriptive, summarising what
                            others had done. After receiving tutor feedback, I realised that I needed to go beyond
                            description and engage critically with methods, datasets, and limitations. This helped me
                            focus the proposal on key research gaps such as interpretability and domain adaptation, and
                            on practical approaches like using BERT and explainable-AI tools such as LIME and SHAP.
                            <br><br>
                            Activities and exercises involving analytics, such as those on summary measures and
                            hypothesis testing, helped me gain hands-on experience with descriptive and inferential
                            statistics. Using Excel functions like AVERAGE, STDEV, and T.TEST, I learned how to
                            calculate and interpret measures such as means, standard deviations, and p-values using
                            Excel. These tasks made me realise how statistical evidence supports decision-making and how
                            much precision matters when interpreting data.
                            <br><br>
                            The data-analysis exercises were also very insightful. Working through the chi-square and
                            t-test worksheets, I saw how theory translates into actual analysis. These examples gave me
                            confidence in selecting appropriate tests, checking assumptions, and interpreting
                            statistical results correctly.
                            <br><br>
                            Alongside these tasks, I used the skills matrix and action plan to reflect on my
                            development. I identified clear improvements in areas such as data handling, use of academic
                            sources, and applying Harvard referencing consistently. By the end of the module, I had
                            moved from seeing research as a mechanical task to understanding it as an intellectual
                            process that combines logic, creativity, and reflection.

                        <h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Looking back, this module has changed how I think about research and evidence. I have come
                            to understand that research is about reasoning and justification, not just calculation.
                            Through the exercises, I developed a much deeper appreciation for how data supports
                            conclusions. For example, when interpreting the results of the t-tests, I realised that
                            small numerical differences could still be statistically meaningful depending on variability
                            and sample size. This has made me more careful when drawing conclusions, both in my studies
                            and at work.


                            <br><br>
                            The literature review process was especially transformative. I learned to read more
                            critically and to look for the reasoning behind methodological choices. Instead of taking
                            research findings at face value, I began to ask why certain models were used, how datasets
                            were selected, and what implications the results had. This shift in thinking helped me
                            improve my own writing by focusing more on argument and evaluation rather than summary. It
                            also made me aware of common issues such as bias in datasets, overfitting, and the
                            challenges of interpretability in AI models. As Cottrell (2019) notes, critical reflection
                            means moving beyond description to evaluation and judgement, which I now see as an essential
                            academic and professional skill.

                            <br><br>
                            I also learned a lot from feedback, I revisited them with a reflective mindset to understand
                            their value. Feedback encouraged me to refine my scope, improve structure, and justify
                            methodological decisions. Following Dweck’s (2017) concept of a growth mindset, I learned to
                            view feedback as part of the learning process rather than as a judgment.

                            <br><br>
                            Another area of growth has been ethics and professional practice. Engaging with the ACM
                            (2018) and BCS (2024) codes of conduct reminded me that ethical responsibility is central to
                            both research and software engineering. Whether handling user data or designing automated
                            systems, it is crucial to ensure fairness, privacy, and transparency. This has changed how I
                            approach testing and data handling at work. I now question how algorithms might produce bias
                            and how data is stored or shared.
                            <br><br>
                            Overall, this module helped me transition from being a passive learner to an active,
                            reflective practitioner. It taught me that good research, like good testing, depends on
                            curiosity, rigour, and continuous evaluation.
                        </p>
                        <h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
                        <p>
                            As I move into my next module, the Master’s dissertation, I feel much better prepared to
                            design and conduct independent research. I now have the confidence to use appropriate
                            methods, justify them clearly, and apply them rigorously when threading into the next and
                            final module. I will be prepared to conduct processes, such as collecting and analysing real
                            data and use statistical skills I developed here, such as conducting t-tests, correlation
                            analysis, and significance testing.
                            <br><br>
                            I also intend to maintain the reflective habits developed through this module will help me
                            document progress, challenges, and decisions throughout my dissertation. Reflection will
                            keep me aware of the reasoning behind each step and help me identify improvements along the
                            way.
                            <br><br>
                            In my professional career, the lessons from this module have already started influencing how
                            I work. In many ways, software testing can be approached as a form of research, framing
                            hypotheses, collecting data, testing outcomes, and interpreting results objectively. I am
                            also more aware of ethical and social factors in technology, especially around bias, data
                            protection, and explainability. These insights have made my professional practice more
                            thoughtful and responsible.
                            <br><br>
                            For my ongoing development, I aim to expand my technical skills by using Python’s
                            data-analysis libraries (such as pandas and SciPy) to handle larger datasets more
                            efficiently. I also plan to keep improving my knowledge of research ethics, especially
                            around AI transparency and data privacy.
                            <br><br>
                            Most importantly, this module has given me a strong foundation for becoming a reflective
                            computing professional. I now see reflection not as an afterthought but as an essential part
                            of learning and practice. As I progress towards my dissertation and beyond, I will continue
                            to use reflective thinking to connect theory, data, and ethical awareness. This mindset will
                            not only help me succeed academically but also make me a more capable and conscientious
                            engineer.
